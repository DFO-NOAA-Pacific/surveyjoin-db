# surveyjoin-db

This repository is for working on the expanded surveyjoin database and development (GSoC 2025 and beyond). 

The original surveyjoin data (as an R package) is available here: [https://github.com/DFO-NOAA-Pacific/surveyjoin](https://github.com/DFO-NOAA-Pacific/surveyjoin)

This data includes surveys conducted by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) off the west coast of the United States, surveys collected by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in the waters of British Columbia, and surveys conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Alaska.
